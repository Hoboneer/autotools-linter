- Support auto-fixing for quoting, required macros, etc.
- Warn on obsolete macros based on user-defined platforms/standards.
- Support warning categories: style, etc.
- Check automake.
- Recognise comments, and allow granular (and non-granular) disabling of atlint.
- Add pypi support.  So, need to store project metadata in multiple places?
